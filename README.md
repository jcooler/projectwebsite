Hi team, hope all is well. I wanted to include this along with the coding exercise to explain what I set out to accomplish with this project

I tried my best to step outside of my comfort zone and implement code in ways I am unfamiliar with as well as adhere to standards and compliances to the best of my knowledge and ability. I decided to take the entire time alloted on this project as I believe submitting the bare minimum ahead of time time isn't always as good as submitting something above expectations on time or slightly earlier than expected. I put a lot of effort into this project and I hope it shows. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thank you again for your consideration!

# compliance

I attempted to follow accessibility standards I found during the research portion of this project to the best of my knowledge and ability.  I also checked for compliance and am proud to say that this project received no A-level or AA-level errors. There were some AAA level errors but I cannot see what they are as the resource I used was free. 


# styling

 I felt it necessary to keep the design to a minimum as this was stated to be a government owned logistics application and in my experience the design has always been kept minimalist and professional. I tried to follow the template provided to show I can take a design and turn it into a reality as opposed to designing and coding what I am comfortable with. I attempted to change the design a bit to keep the form in particular slightly more realistic looking but tried to include a similar amount of elements.


 I also tried to keep in mind that we live in an era where users can have a multitude of devices they work with on a daily basis. I attempted to create this project with that in mind. In my testing I found the following devices compatible with the project:

 iPhones 4, SE, XR, 12 Pro, 6/7/8, 6/7/8 plus, X, 5

 iPad, iPad mini, iPad Air, iPad Pro

 Samsung Galaxy S8+, S20 Ultra, A51/71, note II, note 3, S8, S9+, Tab S4, S III

 Nest Hub, Nest Hub Max

 Surface Pro 7, Surface Duo

 Pixels 2, 2XL, 3, 4, 5


# features
I decided to try to use bootstrap for the form element. I have used bootstrap once for a navbar element but besides that I have no real experience with it. The form is mostly bootstrap and is submittable via a free online resource. The form simply is submitted to my email address I have on file.

 I implemented a dark mode feature toggle as this has been something I have seen heavily requested in many applications over the recent years as dark mode has been said to be easier on the eyes for some users. The Dark mode and light mode toggles both seem to meet accessibility standards.

 I also decided to include a small JQuery element that exposes the form on clicking the link. I have never used JQuery before so my knowledge was very limited. Again, I wanted to use this project as an opportunity to show I am comfortable with being uncomfortable and that I am willing to learn new technologies and methods to accomplish the mission. There can be many right answers to a problem in programming but sometimes there is a better answer and it might not always be something I am familiar with.
 
All of the buttons as well as the link met accessibility standards for contrast as well as being keyboard focusable. This was my first time using JQuery as well as trying to design something with accessibility in mind. Moving forward, designing web applications and other webpages to be accessible to all users will be more of a priority for me.


I was unsure of what the user message element was supposed to say so I decided to use this opportunity to use a new technology. I felt a user message could have meant something that said "successful login" or something of the sort so I decided that displaying the current time would be useful. Alternatively, I could have displayed the time the user logged in. In the research phase of this project I discovered moment.js. The project is considered a legacy project and is currently considered to be in maintenance mode by the developers. I felt this was still a good idea as the developers described this project as not being dead, but simply not adding any new features. The team has simply reallocated dev time to prioritize stability over new features and I feel that stability is a very important priority. 


The project is far from perfect and I am sure there are much more items I could have added or enhanced for a better user experience.
