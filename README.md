# projectwebsite

Hi team, hope all is well. I wanted to include this along with the coding exercise to explain why I made some of the decisions I made. I will leave notes in my code to explain the code itself or the section of code, but not why I used specific code. This will serve to show my logic and the decisions I made. 

I tried my best to step outside of my comfort zone and implement code in ways I am unfamiliar with as well as adhere to standards and compliances to the best of my knowledge and ability. I decided to take the entire time alloted on this project as I believe submitting what is asked ahead of time isn't always as good as submitting something above expectations on time or slightly earlier than expected. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thank you again for your consideration!

# compliance

I attempted to follow accessibility standards I found during the research portion of this project to the best of my knowledge and ability.  I also checked for compliance and am proud to say that this project was 508, WCAG and ADA compliant during the time of the compliance check (date here).


# styling

I chose to not use a library such as Bootstrap and react intentionally to show my experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I believe this was the purpose of the project. I also felt it necessary to keep the design to a minimum as this was stated to be a government owned logistics application and in my experience the design has always been kept minimalist and professional. I tried to follow the template provided to show I can take a design and turn it into a reality as opposed to designing and coding what I am comfortable with.


# features
Unfortunately, due to the time constraints I had with my full-time job I was unable to add some of the features I wanted to add. Orginally, I had planned on a working secure login system as the home page as well as a submittable form. Admittedly, PHP and Databases are not my strong suit and I would need more time to research these technologies in order to provide a feasable solution. I did create a home page to allow the home button on the main app to function, as well as make the project more realistic.

 I did implement a dark mode feature toggle as this has been something I have seen heavily requested in many applications over the recent years as dark mode has been said to be easier on the eyes for some users.
