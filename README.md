# projectwebsite

Hi team, hope all is well. I wanted to include this along with the coding exercise to explain what I set out to accomplish with this project

I tried my best to step outside of my comfort zone and implement code in ways I am unfamiliar with as well as adhere to standards and compliances to the best of my knowledge and ability. I decided to take the entire time alloted on this project as I believe submitting the bare minimum ahead of time time isn't always as good as submitting something above expectations on time or slightly earlier than expected. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thank you again for your consideration!

# compliance

I attempted to follow accessibility standards I found during the research portion of this project to the best of my knowledge and ability.  I also checked for compliance and am proud to say that this project was 508, WCAG and ADA compliant during the time of the compliance check (date here).


# styling

 I felt it necessary to keep the design to a minimum as this was stated to be a government owned logistics application and in my experience the design has always been kept minimalist and professional. I tried to follow the template provided to show I can take a design and turn it into a reality as opposed to designing and coding what I am comfortable with. I attempted to change the design a bit to keep the form slightly more realistic looking but tried to include a similar amount of elements.


# features
Unfortunately, due to the time constraints I had with my full-time job I was unable to add some of the features I wanted to add. Originally, I had planned on a working secure login system as the home page as well as a submittable form. Admittedly, PHP and Databases are not my strong suit and I would need more time to research these technologies in order to provide a feasible solution. The form does submit to my email address using a free solution.

 I did however implement a dark mode feature toggle as this has been something I have seen heavily requested in many applications over the recent years as dark mode has been said to be easier on the eyes for some users. The Dark mode and light mode toggles both seem to meet accessibility standards according to Chrome Dev Tools and my limited knowledge of accessibility standards.

 I also decided to include a small JQuery element that exposes the form on clicking the link. All of the buttons as well as the link met accessibility standards for contrast as well as being keyboard focusable. This was my first time using JQuery as well as trying to design something with accessibility in mind. Moving forward, designing web applications and other webpages to be accessible to all users will be more of a priority for me.
